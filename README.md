A simple bash CLI wrapper for Docker to automate WordPress installations. Traefik for reverse proxy with Lets Encrypt SSL. WordPress sites are powered by NGINX, PHP, and MariaDB.

Demyx is now a Docker image and the code base has been completely rewritten, think of this as a "Version 2." The plan was to not "pollute" the host OS and go full Docker mode. This makes it easier to have a controlled and predictable environment. One can say Demyx is "Linux OS agnostic," as long as you have Docker installed.

### WordPress Features
* SSL turned on by default
* Site-wide request rate limiting
* Basic auth site-wide or wp-login.php
* Secure NGINX/PHP configurations
* Backup/Restore/Clone
* CDN provided by Staticaly
* FastCGI cache with nginx-helper plugin by rtCamp (WooCommerce ready)
* Development mode includes the tools SSH, BrowserSync, phpMyAdmin, and Demyx BrowserSync plugin
* Auto scale containers with callback (see the custom folder)
* Custom healthchecks
* WP-CLI

### Demyx Image
Since the image needs docker.sock to be mounted and the Docker binary is included, I've installed sudo to only allow the demyx user to execute only one script as root. The image is put in production mode by default, meaning that /demyx directory and all it's folders and files will be set to read-only mode. This prevents the non-privelege user to modify the script and do malicious things.

* User/Group: demyx:demyx
* Docker binary
* dumb-init
* bash
* curl
* zsh
* oh-my-zsh
* sudo
* git
* gnupg
* tzdata
* jq

### Privacy
I have a tracker that is enabled by default. It sends a curl request to demyx.sh server daily at midnight PST. No data is collected except your server's IP address, which is logged to the web server like any other visitor on a browser. I have this enabled so I can track how many active installs there are of Demyx. The curl request uses a token (generated by OpenSSL with a passphrase) to prevent abuse and duplicate entries. What I intend to do with this data is just show a graph of active Demyx installs, just like WordPress plugin stats. 

If you are uncomfortable with this, then you can turn off the tracker by running the command below OR keep it turned on to show your support! [COMMIT CHANGES](https://github.com/demyxco/demyx/commit/7deb9bb93bf598c07f0a13107548d397624e7638)
```
# Execute in the host OS
demyx exec stack --tracker=off

# Execute in the demyx container
demyx stack --tracker=off
```

### Requirements
* Docker
* Bash
* Dedicated/KVM server with Linux
* Port 80 and 443 must be open
* Primary domain must be pointed to server's IP and must have a wildcard CNAME subdomain

### Install
```
wget demyx.sh/install && sudo bash install
```

### Upgrade
The script script takes 1 parameter (stack/test/wp) to upgrade each component individually, starting with the stack first. This will move the stack's configs to the demyx container, create a new Docker network, and update all docker-compose.yml to use the new network.
```
wget demyx.sh/upgrade && sudo bash upgrade stack
```
It is RECOMMENDED to test out a single site first to see if the site migrated successfully
```
sudo bash upgrade test domain.tld
```
Then you can migrate all sites in a loop. You can individually migrate them by just using the test parameter.
```
sudo bash upgrade wp
```

What's changed from "Version 1?"
* Demyx code base has been rewritten
* No more bind mounts, all data are stored in volumes
* Traefik's configs are now in docker-compose via cli
* Logrotate was taken off from the stack and now runs as cron by demyx container

### Getting Started
```
# Create a WordPress site on the host OS
demyx exec run domain.tld --auth --cdn --cache

# Create a WordPress site in the demyx container
demyx run domain.tld --auth --cdn --cache
```

### chroot.sh
This script helps you change root to the demyx container, it's installed on the host OS and lives in /usr/local/bin. Executing the install or upgrade script will automatically install the Demyx chroot script. The chroot script will start the demyx container, bind ports 2222 for SSH, and 2022 for Eternal Terminal by default. These ports can be overriden by the script.
```
docker run -dit \
    --name demyx \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    --hostname "$DEMYX_CHROOT_HOST" \
    --network demyx \
    -e DEMYX_HOST="$DEMYX_CHROOT_HOST" \
    -e DEMYX_SSH="$DEMYX_CHROOT_SSH" \
    -e DEMYX_MODE="$DEMYX_CHROOT_MODE" \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
    -v demyx:/demyx \
    -v demyx_user:/home/demyx \
    -v demyx_log:/var/log/demyx \
    -e TZ=America/Los_Angeles \
    -p "$DEMYX_CHROOT_SSH":22 \
    demyx/demyx
```
(host) demyx help
```

      exec            Send demyx commands from host
      help            Demyx help
      rm              Stops and removes demyx container
      rs              Stops, removes, and starts demyx container
      tty             Execute root commands to demyx container from host
      update          Update the demyx chroot
      --dev           Puts demyx container into development mode
      --nc            Starts demyx containr but prevent chrooting into container
      --prod          Puts demyx container into production mode
      --ssh           Override ssh port
```
